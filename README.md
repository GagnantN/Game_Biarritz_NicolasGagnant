## Whatâ€™s the Wild Breakout project?

This is the third project for the end of the 5 months of development at the wild code school.<br>
The Wild asked me to create an interactive portfolio with the brick-breaking game system.<br>
The goal is to use the ball to destroy the bricks allowing to open new tabs with the projects of the other groups.<br>
